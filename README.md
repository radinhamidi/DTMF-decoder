# DTMF-decoder
this app can retrieve dialed numbers from captured/realtime sounds....... sounds cool!,huh?!
Details of procedure are show with tags in program.
currently sound is captured from microphone so if you want to import it from saved file you should add import procedure to the app.

NOTICE : sensivity of application to the timings could be adjusted by changing delay constants.
